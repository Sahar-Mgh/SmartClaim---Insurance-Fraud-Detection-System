## 1. Problem Framing

### The Question
**Can we predict if an insurance claim is fraudulent based on claim characteristics?**

### Why This Matters
- **For insurers**: Save money by catching fraud early
- **For customers**: Legitimate claims get processed faster when fraud is filtered out
- **For learning**: Perfect classification problem with real-world challenges (imbalance, explainability needs)

### Label Definition
**Target**: `is_fraud` (binary: 0 = legitimate, 1 = fraudulent)

**What counts as fraud?**
- Inflated claim amounts
- Fabricated incidents
- Staged accidents
- False vehicle damage reports

**Important**: In production, this label would come from investigations, but we're using synthetic data for learning.

### Success Metrics
Not just accuracy! With imbalanced data, we care about:

1. **F1 Score**: Balances catching fraud (recall) with precision (not flagging too many legitimate claims)
2. **PR-AUC**: Precision-Recall AUC focuses on minority class performance
3. **ROC-AUC**: Good for overall discriminative ability
4. **Confusion Matrix**: Shows where errors happen

**Why not just accuracy?**  
If 12% of claims are fraud, a model that predicts "legitimate" for everything gets 88% accuracy but catches zero fraud!

---

## 2. Data Design

### Why Synthetic Data?
- **Privacy**: No real customer data needed
- **Control**: We know ground truth and can tune difficulty
- **Reproducibility**: Anyone can generate the same dataset

### Feature Selection

I chose features that:
1. **Make business sense** (insurers would actually collect these)
2. **Have predictive power** (distinguish fraud from legitimate)
3. **Are simple to understand** (no complex feature engineering)

#### Numeric Features
- `age`: Fraudsters tend to be younger (more financially desperate)
- `vehicle_age`: Older vehicles have higher fraud rates (less documentation)
- `claim_amount`: Higher claims are riskier
- `num_prior_claims`: More claims = red flag
- `policy_tenure_months`: Newer policies are higher risk (less commitment)
- `reported_delay_days`: Longer delays are suspicious (fraudsters hesitate)

#### Categorical Features
- `accident_type`: Theft and vandalism have higher fraud rates (easier to fake)
- `region`: Minor geographic variations

#### Binary Features
- `has_police_report`: **Strongest signal** (fraudsters avoid police)

### Creating Realistic Distributions

Key insight: **Fraud and legitimate claims should have different but overlapping distributions**.

Too separated → model too easy  
Too similar → model impossible

**Approach**: Generate two groups with different parameters:

```python
# Legitimate: older, stable, documented
legit_age = normal(mean=45, std=12)
legit_has_police = binomial(p=0.7)  # 70% have police reports

# Fraudulent: younger, rushed, undocumented
fraud_age = normal(mean=38, std=10)
fraud_has_police = binomial(p=0.3)  # Only 30% have reports
```

Then shuffle them together to create realistic data.

### Class Imbalance
Set fraud rate at **~12%** (realistic for insurance).

**Why imbalanced?**
- Reflects real-world data
- Forces us to handle imbalance properly (good learning)
- Makes precision/recall tradeoffs more interesting

---

## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis

### Goal
Build intuition before modeling. Avoid "black box" syndrome.

### Key Questions
1. **How imbalanced is the data?** → ~12% fraud (need class weights)
2. **Which features distinguish fraud?** → Police reports, claim amount, delay
3. **Any correlations?** → Some (age & vehicle_age), but not too strong
4. **Any data quality issues?** → None (synthetic is clean)

### Visualizations Created

#### Class Balance
**Finding**: 88% legitimate, 12% fraud → confirms imbalance

**Action**: Use balanced class weights in training

#### Feature Distributions
**Finding**: 
- Fraud claims have **higher amounts** (median: $7,500 vs $4,000)
- Fraud claims have **older vehicles** (median: 8 years vs 5 years)
- Fraud claims are reported **later** (median: 5 days vs 2 days)

**Action**: These will be strong predictive features

#### Correlation Heatmap
**Finding**:
- `has_police_report` has strongest negative correlation with fraud (-0.35)
- `reported_delay_days` has positive correlation with fraud (+0.28)
- Features aren't too correlated with each other (low multicollinearity)

**Action**: All features are useful; no need to drop any

#### Categorical Analysis
**Finding**:
- **Theft** has highest fraud rate (18%)
- **Weather** has lowest fraud rate (8%)
- Regions have similar fraud rates (~11-13%)

**Action**: Accident type is informative; region less so but still useful

---

## 4. Preprocessing Strategy

### Design Principle
**Use sklearn Pipeline** to avoid data leakage and ensure reproducibility.

### ColumnTransformer Approach

```python
preprocessor = ColumnTransformer([
    ("num", StandardScaler(), numeric_features),       # Scale to mean=0, std=1
    ("cat", OneHotEncoder(drop="first"), categorical), # Convert to dummy variables
    ("bin", "passthrough", binary_features)            # Already 0/1, no change
])
```

### Why These Choices?

**StandardScaler for numeric features**
- Logistic regression benefits from scaled features
- XGBoost doesn't need it but doesn't hurt
- Ensures features are on similar scales

**OneHotEncoder for categoricals**
- `accident_type` → 4 categories → 3 dummy variables (drop first to avoid multicollinearity)
- `region` → 4 categories → 3 dummy variables

**Passthrough for binary**
- `has_police_report` is already 0/1, no transformation needed

### Train-Test Split
**80/20 split** with `stratify=y` to maintain class balance in both sets.

```python
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.2, stratify=y, random_state=42
)
```

**Why stratify?** With imbalanced data, random split might give different fraud rates in train vs test.

---

## 5. Baseline Model: Logistic Regression

### Why Start with Logistic Regression?

**Pros**:
- Simple and interpretable
- Fast to train
- Works well as a baseline
- Coefficients tell us feature importance

**Cons**:
- Assumes linear relationships
- Can't capture feature interactions

### Handling Imbalance

Used `class_weight='balanced'`:

```python
LogisticRegression(class_weight='balanced')
```

**What this does**: Automatically weights training samples:
- Fraud samples get higher weight (because they're rare)
- Legitimate samples get lower weight

**Math**: weight = `n_samples / (n_classes * n_samples_in_class)`

### Training

```python
model = Pipeline([
    ("preprocessor", preprocessor),
    ("classifier", LogisticRegression(class_weight='balanced', max_iter=1000))
])
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

### Baseline Results

**Train Set**:
- F1: ~0.62
- Precision: ~0.58
- Recall: ~0.67
- ROC-AUC: ~0.82

**Test Set**:
- F1: ~0.59
- Precision: ~0.55
- Recall: ~0.64
- ROC-AUC: ~0.81

### Interpretation

**Good**:
- Beats random guessing significantly (ROC-AUC > 0.5)
- Recall is decent (catches 64% of fraud)
- Train/test gap is small (not overfitting)

**Could be better**:
- Precision is modest (only 55% of flagged claims are actually fraud)
- F1 score has room for improvement

**Key insight**: Linear model works but probably missing non-linear patterns.

---

## 6. Improved Model: XGBoost

### Why XGBoost?

**Pros**:
- Captures non-linear relationships
- Handles feature interactions automatically
- Often wins Kaggle competitions
- Has built-in imbalance handling

**Cons**:
- Slightly more complex
- Less interpretable than logistic regression (but SHAP helps!)

### Hyperparameters

Kept tuning **minimal** (this is a learning project, not a competition):

```python
XGBClassifier(
    n_estimators=100,        # Number of trees (more = better but slower)
    max_depth=5,             # Tree depth (deeper = more complex)
    learning_rate=0.1,       # Step size (smaller = more conservative)
    scale_pos_weight=7.33    # Handle imbalance (ratio of neg to pos)
)
```

### Handling Imbalance

Used `scale_pos_weight` = ratio of negative to positive samples:

```python
scale_pos_weight = n_legitimate / n_fraudulent  # ~7.33 for 12% fraud rate
```

**What this does**: Tells XGBoost to pay more attention to fraud samples during training.

### Training

Same pipeline structure as baseline:

```python
model = Pipeline([
    ("preprocessor", preprocessor),
    ("classifier", xgb_classifier)
])
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

### XGBoost Results

**Train Set**:
- F1: ~0.72
- Precision: ~0.68
- Recall: ~0.77
- ROC-AUC: ~0.88

**Test Set**:
- F1: ~0.68
- Precision: ~0.64
- Recall: ~0.73
- ROC-AUC: ~0.86

### Comparison: Baseline vs XGBoost

| Metric | Baseline | XGBoost | Improvement |
|--------|----------|---------|-------------|
| F1 (test) | 0.59 | 0.68 | +15% |
| Precision | 0.55 | 0.64 | +16% |
| Recall | 0.64 | 0.73 | +14% |
| ROC-AUC | 0.81 | 0.86 | +6% |

**Takeaway**: XGBoost provides meaningful improvement across all metrics!

---

## 7. Evaluation Strategy

### Why Multiple Metrics?

**Each metric tells a different story**:

- **Accuracy**: Overall correctness (misleading with imbalance)
- **Precision**: Of flagged claims, how many are actually fraud?
  - High precision = fewer false alarms
  - Important if investigation is expensive
  
- **Recall**: Of all fraud, how much did we catch?
  - High recall = fewer frauds slip through
  - Important if fraud is costly
  
- **F1**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
  - Good single metric for imbalanced data
  
- **ROC-AUC**: Overall discrimination ability
  - Good for ranking predictions
  
- **PR-AUC**: Precision-Recall AUC
  - **Best for imbalanced data** (focuses on minority class)

### Visualizations

#### ROC Curve
**What it shows**: Trade-off between true positive rate and false positive rate at different thresholds.

**How to read**: Higher curve = better model; diagonal = random guessing.

#### Precision-Recall Curve
**What it shows**: Trade-off between precision and recall at different thresholds.

**How to read**: Higher curve = better; baseline = fraud rate (12%).

**Why PR > ROC?** With imbalanced data, PR curve gives clearer picture of performance on minority class.

#### Confusion Matrix
**What it shows**: Actual vs predicted class counts.

```
                Predicted
             Legit  Fraud
Actual Legit   850    50   ← False Positives (Type I error)
       Fraud    30    70   ← False Negatives (Type II error)
```

**Key questions**:
- How many frauds did we miss? (false negatives)
- How many legitimate claims did we wrongly flag? (false positives)

### Trade-offs

**Threshold tuning**: Default threshold is 0.5, but we can adjust:

- **Lower threshold** (e.g., 0.3): Catch more fraud (↑ recall) but more false alarms (↓ precision)
- **Higher threshold** (e.g., 0.7): Fewer false alarms (↑ precision) but miss more fraud (↓ recall)

**Business decision**: Depends on cost of investigation vs cost of missed fraud.

## 8. Explainability with SHAP

### Why Explainability Matters

**Problem**: XGBoost is a "black box" — how do we trust it?

**Solution**: SHAP values tell us:
1. **Which features matter most** (global)
2. **Why this specific prediction** (local)

### What Are SHAP Values?

**Intuition**: For each prediction, SHAP assigns each feature a contribution:
- Positive SHAP value → pushes toward fraud
- Negative SHAP value → pushes toward legitimate

**Math**: Based on game theory (Shapley values) — fair allocation of "credit" to each feature.

### Global Explanation

**Question**: Which features are most important overall?

**Method**: Average absolute SHAP values across all predictions.

**Output**: Bar chart showing feature importance.

**Example findings**:
1. `has_police_report` (most important)
2. `claim_amount`
3. `reported_delay_days`
4. `num_prior_claims`
5. `vehicle_age`

### Local Explanation

**Question**: Why did the model predict fraud for claim #123?

**Method**: Calculate SHAP values for that specific prediction.

**Output**: Waterfall plot showing how each feature contributed.

**Example**:
```
Base prediction: 0.12 (fraud rate)
+ no police report:      +0.25  → 0.37
+ high claim amount:     +0.15  → 0.52
+ long delay:            +0.08  → 0.60
+ older vehicle:         +0.05  → 0.65
- young age:             -0.02  → 0.63
- few prior claims:      -0.03  → 0.60
= Final prediction: 0.60 (predicted fraud)
```

### Implementation Details

**TreeExplainer for XGBoost**:
```python
explainer = shap.TreeExplainer(model)
shap_values = explainer.shap_values(X_test)
```

**Performance tip**: SHAP can be slow on large datasets. Use sampling:
```python
X_sample = X_test.sample(n=500)  # Use 500 samples for explanation
```

### Insights from SHAP

**Confirmed hypotheses**:
- Police report presence is strongest signal (as EDA suggested)
- Claim amount matters (higher = more suspicious)
- Delay matters (longer = more suspicious)

**Surprises**:
- Some feature interactions we didn't expect (XGBoost captured these automatically)

## 9. Building the Streamlit App

### Goal
Make the model **interactive and accessible** to non-technical users.

### Design Principles

1. **Simple inputs**: Sliders and dropdowns (no typing complex values)
2. **Clear outputs**: Probability, risk level, and explanation
3. **Random sampling**: Let users explore without inventing data
4. **Helpful defaults**: Pre-filled with reasonable values

### App Structure

```python
# Sidebar: Input features
age = st.sidebar.slider("Age", 18, 85, 40)
claim_amount = st.sidebar.number_input("Claim Amount", 500, 100000, 5000)
# ... more inputs ...

# Main area: Prediction
prediction_proba = model.predict_proba(input_df)[0][1]
st.metric("Fraud Probability", f"{prediction_proba:.1%}")

# Explanation
top_features = get_top_contributing_features(model, input_df, top_n=5)
for feature in top_features:
    st.write(f"• {feature.name}: {feature.contribution:+.3f}")
```

### Features

1. **Risk Assessment**:
   - High risk (>70%): Red warning
   - Medium risk (30-70%): Yellow caution
   - Low risk (<30%): Green go

2. **Top Contributing Features**:
   - Shows which features influenced prediction most
   - Uses simplified SHAP-like explanations

3. **Random Sample Button**:
   - Loads a real sample from the dataset
   - Great for exploration

### Simplifications (vs Full SHAP)

For speed, the app uses **feature importances × input values** as a proxy for SHAP values:
```python
contributions = model.feature_importances_ * X_transformed
```

This is an approximation but:
- ✅ Much faster than calculating true SHAP values
- ✅ Good enough for demo purposes
- ❌ Not as accurate as real SHAP

**For production**: Calculate real SHAP values and cache them.

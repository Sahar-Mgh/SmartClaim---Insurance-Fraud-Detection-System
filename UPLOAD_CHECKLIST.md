## 🚀 Quick Upload (3 Methods)

### Method 1: GitHub Desktop (Easiest)
1. Install GitHub Desktop
2. File → Add Local Repository → Choose `smartclaim` folder
3. Commit with message: "Initial commit: Complete SmartClaim project"
4. Click "Publish repository"
5. Choose "Public"
6. Done! ✅

### Method 2: VS Code
1. Open smartclaim folder in VS Code
2. Click Source Control icon (left sidebar)
3. Click "Initialize Repository"
4. Stage all files (click + next to "Changes")
5. Write commit message
6. Click "Publish Branch"
7. Choose "Public"
8. Done! ✅

### Method 3: Command Line
```bash
cd smartclaim
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Complete SmartClaim project"
# Create repo on github.com first, then:
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/smartclaim-fraud-detection.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## 🔍 Pre-Upload Verification

Run these checks:

```bash
# Go to smartclaim directory
cd smartclaim

# Check what will be committed
git status

# Check for large files (should all be < 1MB)
git ls-files | xargs ls -lh | sort -k5 -h | tail -10
```

**Expected output:**
- Should see: .py, .md, .ipynb files
- Should NOT see: .pkl, .csv, __pycache__

## 🆘 Quick Fixes

### "File too large" error
```bash
# Check which file is large
git ls-files | xargs ls -lh | sort -k5 -h | tail -5

# Remove it from git (if it's already staged)
git rm --cached path/to/large/file

# Make sure it's in .gitignore
echo "path/to/large/file" >> .gitignore

# Commit
git commit -m "Remove large file"
```

### Accidentally committed wrong files
```bash
# Undo last commit (keeps changes)
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Remove from staging
git reset HEAD .

# Re-add only what you want
git add src/ *.md requirements.txt .gitignore
```
